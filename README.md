# ATLA
This is a small project for an Avatar the Last Airbender Database using information form an API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This porject is mainly javascript with some rough HTML and CSS. This project is still a work in progress.

## Optimizations

Fixing the HTML and CSS to make this project look cleaner would definitely elevate this application. I think also connecting to other APIs would allow this project to present more information that I couldn't get from just a singular API (like images of the characters). 
## Lessons Learned:

The big thing I learned from this project is how to use a fetch to receive information from an API and how to sort through the JSON to pick out what I needed and show that on my application.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
